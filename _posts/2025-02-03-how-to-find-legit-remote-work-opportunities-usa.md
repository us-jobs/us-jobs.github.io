## 🛑 How to Spot and Avoid Remote Job Scams  

Not all remote jobs are real. Scammers often **post fake job listings** to steal money or personal information. Here’s how to **identify scams**:

❌ **Upfront Payment Required** – **Legit companies** never ask for money to apply or get hired.  \
❌ **No Online Presence** – **Google the company name**. If it has no website or reviews, it’s likely fake.  \
❌ **Poor Communication** – If emails are unprofessional, **full of errors**, or from free email services (Gmail, Yahoo), be cautious.  \
❌ **Fake Checks & Wire Transfers** – Scammers send fake checks and ask you to send money back—**never accept these offers**.  

  -  **Pro Tip:** Always verify job postings by **researching the company on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Better Business Bureau (BBB)**.
