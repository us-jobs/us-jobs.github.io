## What Are FIFO Jobs?  
FIFO stands for **Fly-In Fly-Out**. It’s a type of employment arrangement where workers travel from their home (often in major cities) to remote job sites, such as mines, oil rigs, or construction projects. Once their work shift is over, they fly back home for an extended period of rest.

Unlike traditional jobs, FIFO careers usually involve:  
- **Long shifts** (10–14 hours daily) for a set roster period.  
- **Rotational schedules** like 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off.  
- **Accommodation provided** by employers near the work site.  

This system allows companies to tap into labor across different regions while ensuring employees still spend significant time at home.
