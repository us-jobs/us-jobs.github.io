## 2. Research and Prepare Before Negotiating

### **Know Your Market Value**
Before negotiating, understand what similar roles pay in the USA. Use tools like:
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com)
- [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com)
- [LinkedIn Salary](https://www.linkedin.com/salary/)
- [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)

### **Consider the Full Compensation Package**
Salary is just one part of your compensation. Look at:
- Bonuses
- Stock options
- Retirement benefits (401k, pension plans)
- Healthcare benefits
- Paid time off (PTO)
- Relocation assistance

### **Set a Target Salary Range**
Based on your research, define a **reasonable** salary range. **Your ideal number should be higher than your minimum acceptable offer.**

Example:
> "The market rate for this position in my area is $75,000–$90,000. I'll target $85,000 but won’t go below $78,000."

## 3. Best Time to Negotiate Your Salary

The best time to discuss salary is **after receiving a job offer** but before signing any contracts. If an employer asks for your salary expectations **early in the hiring process**, try these responses:

- **Deflecting Early Salary Questions:**
> "I'm more focused on finding the right fit, but I’d love to learn more about the role before discussing compensation. Could you share the budgeted range for this position?"

- **When Pressed for a Number:**
> "Based on my research and industry standards, I’d expect a salary in the range of $80,000–$95,000, depending on the total compensation package. Could you let me know what the company has in mind?"

## 4. Effective Salary Negotiation Scripts

### **Scenario 1: Countering an Initial Offer**

- **If the offer is below expectations:**
> "Thank you for the offer! I’m excited about this opportunity. Given my skills and the industry benchmarks, I was expecting something closer to $85,000. Is there flexibility to move towards that number?"

- **If the offer is within range but slightly lower than expected:**
> "I really appreciate the offer and the opportunity to join your team. Considering my experience and the value I bring, would you be open to discussing an increase to $88,000?"

---

### **Scenario 2: Negotiating Additional Perks**

If salary adjustments aren’t possible, negotiate **other benefits** like bonuses, stock options, or remote work.

-**Negotiating PTO and Remote Work:**
> "I understand the salary is firm at $80,000. Would you be open to adding two extra PTO days or considering a hybrid work model?"

-**Asking for a Signing Bonus:**
> "Since the base salary is set at $78,000, could we explore a signing bonus to bridge the gap? I believe a $5,000 bonus would make this offer more aligned with industry standards."

---

### ** Scenario 3: Multiple Job Offers**

If you have competing offers, use them as leverage (without sounding too aggressive).

-**Example Response:**
> "I’m thrilled about this opportunity, and I have another offer that is more aligned with my salary expectations. Your company is my top choice, and I’d love to make this work. Is there room to match the offer at $90,000?"

---

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Salary Negotiation

- **Accepting the first offer without negotiation** – Always counter politely. \
- **Providing salary expectations too early** – It weakens your negotiation power. \
- **Using aggressive language** – Stay professional and collaborative. \
- **Focusing only on salary** – Consider the full compensation package. \
- **Not preparing with research** – Employers respect well-informed candidates.

---

## 6. What to Do If Your Salary Negotiation is Rejected

If an employer declines your request, remain positive.

-**Example Response:**
> "I understand that this is the best offer available, and I appreciate the opportunity. I’m still very excited about joining the team and look forward to contributing. Would it be possible to revisit my salary after 6 months based on my performance?"

Many employers agree to a **performance-based raise review** after a few months.
