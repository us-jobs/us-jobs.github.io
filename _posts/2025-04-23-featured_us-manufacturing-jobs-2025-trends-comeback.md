## 🔁 Reshoring: The Backbone of the Revival

### What Is Reshoring?
Reshoring is the process of bringing manufacturing and production operations back to the United States from overseas. Driven by supply chain issues during the pandemic, U.S. firms are looking to increase reliability and reduce international dependencies.

### Government Incentives
The Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act have provided billions in incentives for companies to build factories and invest in domestic production.

> 📦 **Example:** Intel and TSMC have both broken ground on multi-billion-dollar chip fabrication plants in Arizona, creating thousands of jobs.

### Industries Leading the Charge
- **Semiconductors**
- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**
- **Battery Technology**
- **Pharmaceuticals**
- **Biotech Manufacturing**
