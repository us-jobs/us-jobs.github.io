<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Technology has transformed over the last few years, turning from futuristic ideas into today’s reality. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of these transformative technologies that is now achieving great successes in various real-world applications and made our life more convenient and safe. AI is now shaping the way businesses, governments, and educational institutions do things and is making its way into K-12 classrooms, schools and districts across many countries.</p>

<p>In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of online learning have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in K-12 education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education and promising results have been obtained in solving various critical problems in K-12 education. For examples, AI tools are built to ease the workload for teachers. Instead of grading each piece of work individually, which can take up a bulk of extra time, intelligent scoring tools allow teachers the ability to have their students work automatically graded. What’s more, various AI based models are trained on massive student behavioral and exercise data to have the ability to take note of a student’s strengths and weaknesses, identifying where they may be struggling. These models can also generate instant feedback to instructors and help them to improve their teaching effectiveness.</p>

<p>Despite gratifying achievements have demonstrated the great potential and bright development prospect of introducing AI in K-12 education, developing and applying AI technologies to educational practice is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Hence, this symposium will focus on introducing research progress on applying AI to K-12 education and discussing recent advances of handling challenges encountered in AI educational practice. The proposed symposium builds upon our continued efforts (<a href="http://ai4ed.cc/workshops/aaai2020">AAAI’20 workshop</a>, <a href="http://ai4ed.cc/tutorials/ijcai2020">IJCAI’20 tutorial</a>, <a href="http://ai4ed.cc/tutorials/kdd2020">KDD’20 tutorial</a>) in bringing the AI community members together for the above-mentioned themes. This symposium will bring together AI researchers, learning scientists, educators and policymakers to exchange problems and solutions and build possible collaborations in the future.</p>

<h2 id="symposium-schedule">Symposium Schedule</h2>

<p>Day 1 activities will be centered around the theme of how can <strong>AI to empower K-12 education</strong> (in general)? While day 2 activities will focus on two topics of <strong>NLP Innovation in Educational Applications</strong> and <strong>Innovative Industrial AI Applications in Education</strong>.</p>

<p>We outline the tentative schedule for the proposed symposium. All the time slots are in EST.</p>

  <p><cite>Dr. Kenneth Frank &amp; Dr. Kaitlin Torphy, Michigan State University</cite></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: The past 3 decades have seen accelerating applications of AI in educational contexts.  Many of these applications have yielded important contributions to the fundamental production process of learning by drawing on existing disciplinary knowledge. For example, intelligent tutors informed by the learning sciences provide customized feedback and lessons to students based on their current state of knowledge and cognitive abilities.  Similarly, natural language interpreters informed by psychometrics have broadened the types of assessment that can be used to give feedback to teachers and policymakers.  But less of the AI potential has been realized in the realm of the social processes in which learning is embedded. For example, the new Institute for Student-AI Teaming (iSAT) housed at the University of Colorado Boulder is focused on how AI can support student to student interactions, which will be critical for understanding student motivation and learning.  Here I will also call attention to how AI could be used to understand the teacher’s social context, such as through the interactions in a professional learning community. The success of AI, like other technologies, will depend on our understanding of the ecosystem into which AI is entering, and in particular the teacher’s role in that ecosystem. In this sense as a sociologist I see classroom interaction as a middle ground social space mediating between the social realm of the teachers and that of the students – in this talk I look forward to meeting you in that middle ground.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Artificial intelligence has had a positive impact on education. Today we have accurate models of constructs many didn’t think we could model, dashboards and interventions and (some) evidence they work, and scaled solutions that are being used to change student outcomes. As a field, we have solved some challenging problems. So, what’s next? In this talk, I’ll discuss a few hard problems that could block AI in education from reaching its full potential; some of the big goals I think we can strive to achieve; some of the grand challenges we will need to — and I think can — solve; and perhaps most importantly — how we’ll know if we’ve gotten there. 

Bio: Ryan Baker is Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and Director of the Penn Center for Learning Analytics. His lab conducts research on engagement and robust learning within online and blended learning, seeking to find actionable indicators that can be used today but which predict future student outcomes. Baker has developed models that can automatically detect student engagement in over a dozen online learning environments, and has led the development of an observational protocol and app for field observation of student engagement that has been used by over 160 researchers in 6 countries. Predictive analytics models he helped develop have been used to benefit over a million students, over a hundred thousand people have taken MOOCs he ran, and he has coordinated longitudinal studies that spanned over a decade. He was the founding president of the International Educational Data Mining Society, is currently serving as Editor of the journal Computer-Based Learning in Context, is Associate Editor of two journals, was the first technical director of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center DataShop, and currently serves as Co-Director of the MOOC Replication Framework (MORF).

  <p><cite>Dr. Joseph Jay Williams, University of Toronto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Digital educational resources could enable the use of randomized experiments to answer pedagogical questions that instructors care about, taking academic research out of the laboratory and into the classroom. We take an instructor- centered approach to designing tools for experimentation that lower the barriers for instructors to conduct experiments. We explore this approach through DynamicProblem, a proof-of- concept system for experimentation on components of digital problems, which provides interfaces for authoring of experiments on explanations, hints, feedback messages, and learning tips. To rapidly turn data from experiments into practical improvements, the system uses an interpretable machine learning algorithm to analyze students’ ratings of which conditions are helpful, and present conditions to future students in proportion to the evidence they are higher rated. We evaluated the system by collaboratively deploying experiments in the courses of three mathematics instructors. They reported benefits in reflecting on their pedagogy, and having a new method for improving online problems for future students.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: This talk introduces the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus which was developed to spur the creation of open-source algorithms that identify and evaluate argumentative and discourse elements in 6th-12th grade student writing. The corpus will not only allow for large-scale educational data mining related to categorization of discourse and argumentation elements, but also investigations into relationships among these elements, the quality of these elements and the links between these elements, their relationships, their quality, and holistic scores of essay quality. The corpus was also developed to be nationally representative of the student population found in the United States in relation to socio-economic status and race/ethnicity. Because the corpus contains extensive meta-data, any algorithms developed using the corpus can be assessed for potential bias. As well, the meta-data allows for extensive data mining related to differential student populations and writing assessment and development.

  <p><cite>Dr. Thomas Price, North Carolina State University</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Computer Science (CS) courses are increasingly common in K-12 schools, reflecting growing demand for computational skills across many fields. However, programming is a challenging skill to learn, and teachers are not always available to support students that are struggling. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we can address this challenge by building programming environments that support novice learners automatically with help features, like hints, feedback and examples, that adapt to a student's current code. I will highlight how programming log data can be used to generate this support automatically, as well as to predict student learning outcomes, and to inform curricular design. I will discuss open questions and challenges in this research space, and exciting opportunities to support the next generation of K-12 CS learners.

Bio: Thomas Price is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. His primary research goal is to develop learning environments that automatically support students through AI and data-driven help features. His work has focused on the domain of computing education, where he has developed techniques for automatically generating programming hints and feedback for students in real-time by leveraging student data. His HINTS lab focuses on supporting students working in creative, open-ended and block-based learning contexts, leading to novel data-driven programming support, including adaptive examples, subgoal feedback, and models to predict student outcomes.</code></pre></figure>

  <p><cite>Dr. Erin Walker, University of Pittsburgh</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Reading comprehension is a critical skill for interpreting and learning from narrative and instructional texts in any subject domain. However, it tends to be more challenging to model and support using technologies like intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) than well-defined skills in math and science. In this talk, we will discuss strategies for making thinking visible during reading and for mining log data that enable the development of ITSs for reading comprehension. We will use two projects as examples of this approach. In the first, students made concept maps as they read a text. We used the log data they generated to extract sequences of productive and unproductive concept mapping strategies and to give students adaptive feedback on their strategies. In the second, students read a digital storybook, and moved images to simulate the content of the sentences of the story. We demonstrated how we can use their log data to make inferences about their understanding. We close with recommendations for future work within this space of automatically supporting reading comprehension.

Bio: Erin Walker is an Associate Professor at the University of Pittsburgh with a joint appointment in the School of Computing and Information and the Learning Research and Development Center. Her research focuses on the application of intelligent tutoring technologies to social learning environments (both human-human and human-robot) and to modeling cognitive states during learning. It has resulted in approximately 45 peer reviewed publications, including 5 best paper awards or nominations at AIED, CSCL, and Creativity and Cognition. </code></pre></figure>

  <p><cite>Dr. Alex Bowers, Columbia University</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: In K-12 education, early warning systems and early warning indicators (EWS/EWI) to predict overall student outcomes are a central component of modern school data analytics dashboards and decision-making. Yet, the research literature in the domain has shown that 1) most EWIs are not accurate, misidentifying 40% or more of students, 2) recent machine learned EWIs lack generalizability across schooling systems, 3) current EWIs are often not benchmarked for accuracy, 4) and there is a recent trend in which algorithms across this domain are rarely open access and public, despite being paid for by the taxpayer. In this talk, Alex J. Bowers will discuss his research on EWS/EWI in K-12 education, focusing on issues of algorithmic accuracy, openness, the predictive validity of longitudinal non-cumulative grade point average, and the emerging domain of Education Leadership Data Analytics (ELDA) which brings together decision-making, evidence-based improvement cycles, and data science in schooling systems.

Bio: Alex J. Bowers is an Associate Professor of Education Leadership at Teachers College, Columbia University, where he works to help school leaders use the data that they already collect in schools in more effective ways to help direct the limited resources of schools and districts to specific student needs. His research focuses on the intersection of effective school and district leadership, organization and HR, data driven decision making, student grades and test scores, student persistence and dropouts. His work also considers the influence of school finance, facilities, and technology on student achievement. He studies these areas through the application of Education Leadership Data Analytics (ELDA), which is at the intersection of education leadership, evidence-based improvement cycles, and data science.</code></pre></figure>

  <p><cite>Dr. Kurt VanLehn, Arizona State University</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: When the pandemic forced middle school classes to be conducted remotely using synchronous video conferencing (e.g., Zoom), it was not clear that classroom orchestration systems designed for ordinary, face to face classrooms could still help teachers teach. This talk presents observations from the use of one such system in 9 middle school math classes. Our FACT system was designed for instructional activities done in small groups with paper cards and posters. Teachers had stopped using such activities when their classes became remote. FACT enabled them to use them again. However, each small group met in its own breakout room. Although FACT is an automated teaching assistant in that it has the intelligence to partially understand students’ errors and their collaboration (or lack thereof), teachers and students seems to ignore most of its help as they struggled with the extra load of managing breakout rooms. The talk’s main results are simply a list of informally derived observations about what worked and didn’t work.

  <p><cite>Dr. Shayan Doroudi, University of California, Irvine</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Over the past two decades, researchers have continuously developed new ways to conduct knowledge tracing, a technique that underpins algorithmic approaches to mastery learning in education. However, many state-of-the-art learning platforms that are used by millions of students each year, use heuristics—as opposed to data-driven algorithms—to assess mastery. Why is there such a gap between research and practice when it comes to mastery learning? In this talk, I show that two mastery learning heuristics can actually be reinterpreted as model-based algorithms. Specifically, I show that they can be viewed as optimal policies under variants of the popular Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) model. By analyzing the assumptions made by these models, we can discuss whether using these heuristics in practice is reasonable. I claim that one of these heuristics (a variant of the heuristic used by ALEKS) seems reasonable because (a) it is easy to understand, (b) makes weaker assumptions about how students learn than the BKT model, and (c) seems to perform favorably in simulations. Moreover, this heuristic establishes a connection to the change point detection literature in statistics, which, to my knowledge, has not been connected to mastery learning previously.

Such data also provide a rich, if challenging, source of knowledge that can be mined with AI methods. I will discuss two projects that exemplify this computational approach to analyzing classroom data that were originally collected with very different analyses in mind. In one project, researchers recorded videos of secondary school math classrooms to explore research questions via expert video coding. We developed computer vision methods to analyze these videos at a larger scale and thus answer new research questions. In the second project, researchers recorded audio interviews with secondary school students who described their experiences learning with a computer-based learning environment for natural science topics. We reanalyzed transcripts of these interviews via natural language processing methods to answer research questions related to students' expressions of metacognition. Through these projects, I will illustrate the need for adapting AI methods to mine useful information from data that were not originally collected with such analyses in mind. I will also highlight the value of doing so to enable novel research in collaboration with researchers taking quite different approaches to the same data.

  <p><cite>Adit Gupta and Christopher MacLellan</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) consistently improve students’ educational outcomes when used alone or in combination with traditional instruction (MacLellan et al. 2018). One major barrier to the wider use of AI tutoring systems is that they are non-trivial to build, requiring both time and expertise. Typically, authoring a tutor takes 200-300 hours of developer time to produce an hour of instruction time (Aleven et al. 2009; Weitekamp, Harpstead, and Koedinger 2020). Existing authoring methods, including Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tool’s (CTAT) Example Tracing and SimStudent’s Authoring by Tutoring approaches, let authors create ITSs quicker than traditional approaches, such as hand program- ming. While Example Tracing and Authoring by Tutoring re- duce the time and expertise required to create an ITS, such techniques do not allow humans to teach AI technologies in ways that are natural to humans. In this paper, we propose a research plan based on Natural Training Interactions (NTI) framework (MacLellan et al. 2018) that aims to create more human-centered and efficient tutor authoring tools. We pro- pose dual-sided, restricted-perception Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiments, a novel variant of commonly used WoZ experiments, to prototype teachable AI technologies for tutor authoring. We engineered the NTI testbed to allow novel tasks to be studied in WoZ experiments without having to start from scratch for each experiment. Lastly, we propose three research questions that we believe will help us understand how to create teachable AI technology to power tutoring systems. The NTI framework aims to produce teachable agents that can be used by teachers and other non-programmers to naturally and efficiently author ITSs.</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are widely applied in K-12 education to help students to learn and master skills. Knowledge tracing algorithms are embedded in the tutors to keep track of what students know and do not know, in order to better focus practice. While knowledge tracing models have been extensively studied in offline settings, very little work has explored their use in online settings. This is primarily because conducting experiments to evaluate and select knowledge tracing models in classroom settings is expensive. We explore the idea that machine learning models that simulated students might fill this gap. We conduct experiments using such agents generated by Apprentice Learner (AL) Architecture to investigate the online use of different knowledge tracing models (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and the Streak model). We were able to successfully A/B test these different approaches using simulated students. An analysis of our experimental results revealed an error in the implementation of one of our knowledge tracing models that was not identified in our previous work, suggesting AL agents provide a practical means of evaluating knowledge tracing models prior to more costly classroom deployments. Additionally, our analysis found that there is a positive correlation between the model parameters achieved from human data and the parameters obtained from simulated learners. This finding suggests that it might be possible to initialize the parameters for knowledge tracing models using simulated data when no human-student data is yet available.</code></pre></figure>

This application combines state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities with automated speech recognition to automatically analyze classroom recordings and provide teachers with personalized feedback on their use of specific types of discourse aimed at broadening and deepening classroom conversations about mathematics. These specific discourse strategies are referred to as “talk moves” within the mathematics education community and prior research has documented the ways in which systematic use of these discourse strategies can positively impact student engagement and learning. In this article, we describe the TalkMoves application’s cloud-based infrastructure for managing and processing classroom recordings, and its interface for providing teachers with feedback on their use of talk moves during individual teaching episodes. We present the series of model architectures we developed, and the studies we conducted, to develop our best-performing, transformer-based model (F1 = 79.3\%). We also discuss several technical challenges that need to be addressed when working with real-world speech and language data from noisy K-12 classrooms.</code></pre></figure>

Still, AI remains in its infancy and we continue to discover what learners and educators need and how to deliver it to them meaningfully and ethically. It’s important that the field align on foundational principles of how we research and develop technology-enhanced learning solutions so that we continue to work toward AI for good. 

In this talk I will discuss three foundational principles of the application of AI to educational technology. The first is that AI is assistive to offer learners and their support networks efficiencies that personalize the educational experience so they can meet their goals. Second, that AI scientists and developers have the responsibility to demonstrate evidence of what works, for whom, and why both to build trust among users and to drive the field forward. And third, that AI be leveraged for good, with equity in education as cornerstone to any research and development efforts.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are highly effective at promoting learning as compared to other computer-based instructional approaches. Their particular strengths lie in their ability to mimic personalized and interactive tutoring in a computer-based environment, providing students with step-by-step guidance during problem solving, tracking students’ skills and knowledge development, and selecting problems on an individual basis. Yet, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules, which makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains, and limits their potential efficacy. In this talk, I will overview data-driven methods of automated feedback generation in a large-scale ITS and discuss how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student learning outcomes. Specifically, I will show how machine learning approaches and natural language processing techniques can be used to provide students with a variety of personalized pedagogical interventions. Such automated personalized interventions take individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need for expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. I will demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved learning outcomes in practice, and I will overview experiments with our personalized feedback model in Korbit, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with over 15,000 students launched in 2019. The results of the conducted experiments show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to a significant overall improvement in student learning outcomes and substantial improvements in the subjective evaluation of the feedback.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: In this talk, the author discusses how multiagent AI architecture can be applied to the future of adaptive instructional systems (AIS) to enable a new breed of educational AI.

Advances in technology have changed the landscape of education. They have improved access to education, delivering educational content at scale without limitations of space and temporal synchrony. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are extremely useful learning tools for both teachers and students. While providing materials that help students learn remotely, most educational technology platforms are limited in their personalization capability, leaving the burden of content choice to the student or instructors. Like a vast empty library, these learning management systems (LMS), video sharing platforms, and mobile applications make knowledge available, but provide few signposts that tell the student where to begin or go next.

A small but growing set of tools are in the category now called Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS), e.g. Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring, GIFT; Sottilare, Goldberg, Brawner <span class="err">&amp;</span> Holden, 2012. These AIS provide individually tailored recommendations, feedback, or both, to students based on strategies informed by learner goals, preferences, attributes, and instructional conditions (Sottilare, Barr, Robson, Hu <span class="err">&amp;</span> Grasser, 2018). AIS bring together research in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and education to characterize a student’s knowledge and offer him or her the best available resources to meet learning goals.

AIS can perform as well as human tutors (VanLehn, 2011). However, this success is limited to a few well-defined domains, and AIS are far from ubiquitous (Sottilare, 2018). Sottilare (2018) identified 8 goals for AIS enhancement to bring AIS closer towards becoming ubiquitous instructional tools. We envision that OLI Adaptive Framework (OLAF), an adaptive LMS with an innovative multiagent adaptive architecture, and the research it enables, will help move towards many of the goals that Sottilare set out. These are Developing Efficient Authoring Processes (Goal 1), Developing Effective Instructional Decisions (Goal 2), Building Rapport and Engagement with Learners (Goal 4), Expanding Adaptive Instruction to a Broader Array of Task Domains (Goal 6), and Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Adaptive Instructional Systems (Goal 7). In addition, OLAF aims to expand the possibilities of AIS by enabling ML driven and human-in-the-loop adaptive instruction and allow for much easier research experiments and AI expansion.

Our ultimate vision for OLAF is to provide a reference implementation for standards for the future of AI systems in education. Like a personal librarian in the empty library, the AI system makes use of a vast trove of available content to show the students the ropes of a domain, while also considering how it can do this better in the future. We believe that OLAF’s development will upgrade the AIS community’s current toolset for building adaptive online courses and serve as a template for the enhancement of current systems. Having addressed key challenges for AIS, next-generation systems like OLAF will be far more capable of achieving ubiquitous application to provide high quality personalized learning at scale. We also believe that in doing so, OLAF will have enabled several advances in fields such as explainable AI, learner and pedagogical modeling, multi-agent systems in complex domains. OLAF’s feature set and adoption in real-world settings will also accelerate research in the AI for learning and education.

  <p><cite>Dr. Qianying Wang, Lenovo Group</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: The efficiency improvement and business model transformation, made possible by the smartification of industries, will be the major driving force of the growth of the digital economy in the future. This presentation will focus on Lenovo's smart education practices, and explore how artificial intelligence could enable K-12 education. It will also make clear that, when empowering education with cutting-edge technologies, education itself is the end, while technology is the means. And smart education solutions should primarily meet the needs of teachers and students, with teaching and learning being the key scenarios. First of all, the problem of efficiency should be addressed. Artificial intelligence is expected to provide whole-process, multi-dimensional and fine-grained teaching and learning support, thus could become the best teaching assistant in human history, and helping teachers, students, parents and education administrators reduce workloads and boost efficiency. Secondly, the reform of education systems and models needs to be studied to see whether artificial intelligence would likely redefine the learning environment, and deliver brand-new teaching and learning experiences.

  <p><cite>Mr. Elliot Robson, Eduworks Corporation</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: This session covers technology advances that allow dynamic and adaptive pedagogy to be deployed in portable eBooks. The Personalized eBooks for Learning (PeBL) project is part of the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative’s (ADL) Total Learning Architecture (TLA). PeBL allows new learner-adaptive pedagogy, typically found in bespoke cloud-based training, to work in eBooks while maintaining offline capabilities. This presentation will demonstrate (a) eBook creation tools that make reusing or creating new adaptive learning content easy, (b) PeBL-enhanced training interfacing with other adaptive learning systems to provide personalized content to the learner, and (c) using eXperience API (xAPI) data generated by PeBL eBooks to power a LRS or instructor dashboard.

  <p><cite>Wejdan Alkaldi and Diana Inkpen</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Abstract: Year after year, reading becomes more important to keep up with the growing amount of knowledge. The ability to read a document varies from person to person depending on their skills and knowledge. It also depends on the readability level of the text, whether it matches the reader’s level or not. In this paper, we propose a system that uses state-of-the-art technology, including deep learning, to classify text documents into their appropriate readability level. We design several features, including readability metrics. Our models are trained on on the Newsela dataset, that is labeled with five readability levels. We also propose an improved version of the dataset, that we use in order to achieve higher classification accuracy. This work could be beneficial to educators in assisting readers with different reading levels, in order to choose materials that match their readability level.</code></pre></figure>
