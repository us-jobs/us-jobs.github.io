At **US Jobs** (**us-jobs.github.io**), transparency is important to us. This page explains how we use affiliate links and how they may impact you.  

### 1. What Are Affiliate Links?  
Some of the links on our website may be affiliate links, which means we earn a small commission if you click on the link and make a purchase or sign up for a service. This comes at no extra cost to you.  

### 2. Why Do We Use Affiliate Links?  
Affiliate partnerships help us maintain and grow our website by covering costs such as hosting, content creation, and research. Our goal is to provide valuable job-related content while keeping the site free for users.  

### 3. How Do Affiliate Links Affect You?  
- Clicking an affiliate link does not increase the price you pay for a product or service.  
- We only promote job boards, career tools, and services that we believe may be useful to our audience.  
- You are under no obligation to click on any affiliate link or make a purchase through our recommendations.  

### 4. Third-Party Responsibility  
While we strive to recommend reputable products and services, **US Jobs** is not responsible for the policies, practices, or actions of any third-party companies linked on our website. We encourage users to review the terms and conditions of any service before signing up.  

### 5. Changes to This Disclosure  
We may update this Affiliate Disclosure as needed. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated date.
